# Vibetran

A finite element solver written in modern C++20 that attempts to be
Nastran/Mystran-compatible.

## Why

I was curious how feasible it would be to create something this complex with an AI agent. It's a well documented field, but it also requires that the math is precisely correct. I also wanted to experiment with seeing how fast a FEM solver could be when written in a language I understand (well, within the limits of one's ability to understand C++), and using GPU acceleration. I was prepared to do the benchmarking and optimization myself, but it turned out that Claude was quite capable with some guidance. 

Vibetran draws significant inspiration from the [Mystran](https://github.com/MYSTRANsolver/MYSTRAN)
project. If you're unfamiliar with the Mystran project you should go look at it first. It should be considered the reference for open source Nastran-compatible solvers. Without it, as an introduction to OSS FEM Solvers, there's zero chance I would have tried this.

The OpenJFEM project, which is another solver, written in Julia, was also an inspiration for trying this with an agent.

## Performance

More coming soon. 84k elem/170k node hex mesh model solves in 2.6sec on M2 macbook air, 3.6sec on an rtx3060 12gb+ryzen 5700, and 4.3s on the ryzen 5700 alone.

## Design Principles

- **Separation of concerns**: Parser, FE model, solver, and output are independent layers
- **Extensibility**: New element types implement `ElementBase`; new solvers implement `SolverBackend`
- **Modern C++20**: spans, ranges, strong types, error values over exceptions throughout
- **Performance**: Hash maps are wonderful. TBB for parallel operations. Hardware acceleration via CUDA or Accelerate (eventually Vulkan). 

## Supported Features

- **Elements**: CQUAD4, CTRIA3, CHEXA8, CHEXA20, CTETRA4, CTETRA10, CPENTA6
- **Materials**: MAT1 (isotropic)
- **Properties**: PSHELL, PSOLID
- **Loads**: FORCE, MOMENT, TEMP (thermal)
- **Constraints**: SPC, SPC1, MPC, RBE2, RBE3
- **Coordinate systems**: CORD1R/C/S, CORD2R/C/S
- **Input formats**: Nastran BDF (`.bdf`) and CalculiX/Abaqus (`.inp`, experimental)
- **Solution**: SOL 101 (Linear Static)

## Building

```bash
meson setup build
cd build
ninja
meson test
```

Optional solver backends are detected automatically at configure time.

## Usage

```
vibetran [--backend=<cpu|cpu-pcg|vulkan|cuda|cuda-pcg>]
         [--cuda-single-precision] [--csv]
         <input.bdf|input.inp> [output.f06]
```

Both Nastran BDF (`.bdf`) and CalculiX/Abaqus (`.inp`) input files are supported.
The format is detected by file extension. If no output path is given, it defaults
to `<input>.f06`.

### CalculiX/Abaqus `.inp` support (experimental)

The `.inp` parser accepts standard CalculiX input files and maps them to the same
internal model used by the BDF parser. Supported keywords include `*NODE`,
`*ELEMENT`, `*MATERIAL`/`*ELASTIC`/`*DENSITY`/`*EXPANSION`, `*SOLID SECTION`,
`*SHELL SECTION`, `*BOUNDARY`, `*CLOAD`, `*TEMPERATURE`, `*STEP`/`*STATIC`/`*END STEP`,
and output request keywords (`*NODE FILE`, `*EL FILE`, `*NODE PRINT`, `*EL PRINT`).

Supported element types: C3D8, C3D4, C3D10, C3D6, S4, S3 (and their R variants).
C3D20 is not currently supported.

See `include/io/inp_parser.hpp` for full details on design decisions and limitations.

### Output files

| File | Format | Written when |
|---|---|---|
| `<stem>.f06` | F06 text | Always |
| `<stem>.op2` | OP2 binary | Set via case control deck |
| `<stem>.node.csv` | Nodal results CSV | `--csv` flag or `PARAM,CSVOUT,YES` in BDF |
| `<stem>.elem.csv` | Element results CSV | `--csv` flag or `PARAM,CSVOUT,YES` in BDF |

## Solver Backends

### CPU — Cholesky (default)

Eigen sparse Cholesky. Always available, no extra dependencies. Uses CHOLMOD or Apple Accelerate when available.

```bash
vibetran --backend=cpu model.bdf
```

### CPU — PCG

Eigen Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient with Incomplete Cholesky preconditioning.
Iterative solver with O(nnz) memory — suitable for very large systems where the
direct Cholesky fill-in would exhaust RAM. This is slower than the direct (Cholesky) solution.

```bash
vibetran --backend=cpu-pcg model.bdf
```

### CUDA — cuDSS

Uses [NVIDIA cuDSS](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudss) for GPU-resident sparse
direct solve. Requires CUDA toolkit ≥ 11 and cuDSS ≥ 0.7.

**Solver strategy:**
1. Sparse Cholesky (`CUDSS_MTYPE_SPD`) — optimal for SPD FEM stiffness matrices
2. Sparse LU (`CUDSS_MTYPE_GENERAL`) fallback for non-SPD or ill-conditioned matrices

**Memory management:**
- After symbolic analysis, cuDSS memory estimates are logged (device/host stable and peak).
- If the estimated device peak exceeds 85% of free GPU memory, hybrid host/device memory
  mode is enabled automatically so factor storage spills to host RAM.
- If analysis itself fails with an allocation error, hybrid mode is retried before giving up.
- In theory Hybrid mode allows for very large systems to be solved, but in practice that hasn't been achieved (yet).

```bash
vibetran --backend=cuda model.bdf
```

**Single-precision mode** halves GPU memory usage by downcasting to float32 before the
solve and upcasting the result. Useful for very large models that exhaust device memory
even with hybrid mode. Applies to both `--backend=cuda` and `--backend=cuda-pcg`:

```bash
vibetran --backend=cuda --cuda-single-precision model.bdf
```

#### Installing cuDSS (Ubuntu 24.04)

Download the deb from Nvidia, then install:
```bash
# Add the local repo and install
sudo dpkg -i cudss-local-repo-ubuntu2404-*.deb
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libcudss0-cuda-12 libcudss0-dev-cuda-12
```

### CUDA — PCG

GPU Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient with IC0 → ILU0 → Jacobi fallback preconditioning,
using cuSPARSE SpSV for triangular solves and cuBLAS for vector operations.
O(nnz) device memory — no factorization fill-in — making it suitable for systems too large
for cuDSS even with hybrid host/device memory mode. This is slower than the cuDSS direct solve for most cases.

```bash
vibetran --backend=cuda-pcg model.bdf
```

**Single-precision mode** halves VRAM usage by performing the entire PCG solve in float32:

```bash
vibetran --backend=cuda-pcg --cuda-single-precision model.bdf
```

Requires CUDA toolkit ≥ 11 with cuBLAS and cuSPARSE (both included in the standard toolkit).

### Vulkan - Experimental

PCG iterative solver using Vulkan compute shaders. Requires Vulkan SDK, `glslc`, and `xxd`. Unfortunately performance is terrible right now, it's orders of magnitude slower than the base Eigen Cholesky CPU solver.

```bash
vibetran --backend=vulkan model.bdf
```
